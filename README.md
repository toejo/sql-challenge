This repository contains deliverables for Module 9's SQL Challenge.

Included inside the 'EmployeesSQL' folder is an (1) image file of an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) generated from QuickDBD (as well as a word file containing the code used to produce the ERD in case changes needed to be made), (2) a SQL file of the resulting table schemata, and (3) a SQL file of the queries made to analyze the data.

The data used for this project can be found in the "data" folder within the "EmployeesSQL" folder.
